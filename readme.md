# Preact

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with Hmr and some EsLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-preact](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-preact/blob/main/packages/plugin-preact/Readme.md)
- uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-preact-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-preact-swc)
- uses [Swc](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
